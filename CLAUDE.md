# CLAUDE.md

Persistent instructions for this repository. Keep this file short and specific — vague rules get
followed inconsistently.

## What this is

A Monte Carlo simulation of an 8-team IDP fantasy football league (Sleeper). It is a
quantitative modelling project, not a CRUD app: the correctness bar is statistical, not just
"does it run". A change that runs cleanly and silently alters the distribution is a failure.

## Commands

Runtime is **Python 3.10** with the pins in `requirements.txt` (exact for the
numeric stack the goldens are byte-locked to; ranges for plumbing like `requests`) (`py -3.10 -m pip install -r
requirements.txt`). On this machine plain `python` resolves to the retired Windows Store Python
3.8 -- do not use it: it is pinned to end-of-life numpy/scipy and produced an intermittent native
access violation in the test process (`AUDIT_PLAN.md` R1). Use the launcher:

```bash
py -3.10 -m unittest discover tests      # full suite — 2316 tests, must all pass
py -3.10 -m tests.test_golden_master     # reproducibility harness — 15 tests, three scenarios, byte-exact
py -3.10 -m tests.golden_sync            # sync-stage golden: baseline generation from pinned inputs (--regenerate = MAJOR)
py -3.10 -m scripts.run_behavior_check   # sim mechanic rates vs real 2025 + drift vs committed baseline
py -3.10 -m scripts.run_behavior_check --scenario week06   # M2: BOTH scenarios before a MAJOR and at milestone tags
py -3.10 -m scripts.weekly_report        # PRIMARY ENTRY POINT: sync -> simulate -> charts -> tools -> HTML+MD digest; fails loud
py -3.10 -m scripts.check_freshness      # has sync run this week, and did it succeed? (OK / DEGRADED / STALE)
py -3.10 -m scripts.run_sync             # pull live data into data/current/ (writes the sync manifest last)
                                         # H5: checks ODDS_API_KEY first; a REJECTED key (401/403) stops before

                                         # value -- inject the User scope, or pass --allow-fallback on purpose.
                                         # Out of credits is the same 401 but its own verdict (`exhausted`): the key
                                         # is fine, it stops the same way, and credits return at the monthly reset.

                                         # weekly_report --canonical) always fetches fresh and may spend the reserve.

```

**Run the behaviour check on BOTH scenarios** (M2/F81) before a MAJOR and at milestone
tags. `week01` has ZERO completed weeks, so `_apply_bayesian_updates` is a no-op there and
anything scoped to the blend is invisible to it -- B8 moved the week06 and week15 goldens
and the check reported no drift (F54, F62). `week06` carries five completed weeks and sees
it. Both baselines live in `tests/fixtures/behavior/`; regenerate deliberately, in its own
commit, with the deltas explained. Note the known limit, unchanged: drift tolerance is 2%
while one SE on `faab_spent` is +-2.1%, so a drift of a few percent on that metric is not
evidence of a behaviour change, and a second scenario doubles the false-alarm chances.

**Run `scan_real_names` before any push that touched tests, docs, or fixtures** (H1). It
needs `SHOW_REAL_TEAM_NAMES` set in that shell and refuses on a runner; it fetches names
live, writes nothing, and prints only the matched TOKEN so a coincidence (NFL player names
are domain data, not identities) can be told from a leak. Adjudicated false positives go in
`.real_name_scan_allow`, which is gitignored on purpose -- a committed list of "ordinary
words to ignore" assembled from real names would be the leak it exists to prevent. A
literal-match scan is not a substitute: one passed on 2026-09-22 with four real-identity
strings sitting in tracked files, and this scan found a fifth on its first run (F73).

**Pending trades are advisory (T3/F78).** Sync writes `data/current/pending_trades.json`;
`find_trades` and `trade_leverage` skip the players in it and say so. It is CURRENT STATE,
rewritten each sync, and no roster, lineup or simulation ever reads it -- pending is not
complete, and a vetoed trade returns the players. `--include-pending` overrides.

The seven decision tools (`scripts/compare_players`, `optimize_lineup`, `matchup_lineup`,
`waiver_targets`, `evaluate_trade`, `find_trades`, `roster_grades`) and their one-line
questions are listed in `README.md`; they read `data/current/` only and never touch the engine
or the season exports.

Expected verdict: `OK (skipped=1, expected failures=3)`. The skip is the live-ingestion test
(`RUN_LIVE_INGESTION_TESTS=1` runs it); the three expected failures are deliberate red
characterisations of tracked open items (`AUDIT_SUMMARY.md`; a fourth, the dead trade
mechanism, flipped to a guard when `AUDIT_PLAN.md` F2 commit 1 landed on 2026-09-01). `espn_api` is in
`requirements.txt`; without it 3 more tests skip cleanly (`skipped=4`) -- expected, not a failure.
`hypothesis` is pinned `<6.120` because 6.165 fails inside its own engine on Python 3.10.0
(verified not to be the example database); revisit on a later 3.10.x.

**Environment (F37, 2026-09-05):** the league identifiers are env-only --
`SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID`, `ESPN_LEAGUE_ID`, `SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID_2025` (backtests),
`SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID_2024` (B20: the renewal chain is broken at 2025, so the 2024
league is unreachable without it -- `config.KNOWN_LEAGUE_IDS`) -- plus
`ODDS_API_KEY` for real lines. The test suite needs NONE of them (hermetic by design --
F48: keep it that way, the real-name default lives in `scripts.weekly_report`, never in
the library, or rendering starts fetching live data mid-test);
sync and the backtests refuse loudly, naming the variable, when one is missing. On the
runner they are repo Actions secrets of the same names.

## Rules of engagement

These are non-negotiable and exist because each was learned the hard way on this codebase.

1. **Write the failing test before the fix.** A test written after a fix proves nothing. If the
   test does not fail against the current (broken) behaviour, it is not a regression test — say
   so plainly rather than presenting it as verified.

2. **Never claim verification you have not performed.** If a test cannot be made to catch a
   given regression, state that as a coverage gap. Do not present passing tests as evidence of
   a property they do not actually test.

3. **Separate characterisation from remediation.** One commit for tests that expose behaviour,
   a second for the fix. This keeps "what was wrong" reviewable independently of "what changed".

4. **Do not refactor what is not covered by intent.** `run_simulation` (~585 lines) and
   `export_and_visualize` (~485 lines, 2026-09-03; they grow) ARE pinned byte-exactly by the golden master (Phase 0
   is complete; coverage there is execution, not assertion — see F26). Decomposition is
   Phase 8, which stays blocked until the R1 hardware is replaced and Arm D passes 12/12 —
   the golden certifies refactors only on a machine that can be trusted to run it.

5. **Every constant cites a source or is marked unverified.** Numbers in `config.py` carry
   comments explaining their derivation. Preserve that. A new constant with no sourcing comment
   is not acceptable; "unverified, carried over" is acceptable and honest.

6. **Run the full suite before and after every change.** Report the count. Investigate any
   change in the number of tests that run, not just failures.

7. **Prefer finding the real defect over satisfying the test.** If a test fails, diagnose the
   cause before editing either side. Loosening an assertion to make a suite green is a
   regression in disguise.

8. **Closing a finding closes it everywhere, in the same commit.** Resolving,
   retiring, or measuring-and-clearing any finding updates `AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` alongside
   `AUDIT_PLAN.md`, and the status keyword (CLEARED / CLOSED / RESOLVED / BUILT) goes in
   the plan's F-heading so `tests/test_docs` can cross-check. F27 exists because this rule
   did not: the summary went stale on eighteen findings while the plan stayed current.

9. **Every phase branches from `main`, never from another phase's branch.** After a phase
   merges, delete its branch. If `git log <new-branch> --oneline` shows commits from a
   different `audit/phase-N-*` branch, the branch point was wrong — stop and re-branch from
   `main` before doing any work.

10. **The web UI has two views, and every UI change is made for both** (docs/WEB_UI.md W8,
    2026-09-27). `dev` is the owner's (files, jobs, logs, sync, codes); `simple` is the one
    anyone could use. `tests.test_webui_modes` renders every simple page and fails on
    developer vocabulary in the visible text — a new page, tool or sentence is either
    plain in both views or inside `{% if dev %}`. Do not add UI that only works in one.

## Deliberate decisions — do not "fix" these

Each of these looks like a defect and is not. Changing any of them requires explicit discussion.

- `SIM_CONFIG['MEDIAN_SCORING_ENABLED'] = False` in the season backtest. The 2025 season really
  was pure H2H; the flag exists so a historical season is simulated under the rules that applied.
- `ESPN_BLEND_ELIGIBLE_POSITIONS` excludes K and IDP from the POINTS-level mean blend.
  The original reasoning -- Sleeper and ESPN scoring cannot be matched at the points level --
  was measured by F29 (2026-09-02) as right about points and wrong about STAT LINES: ESPN's
  projected stat lines, scored under this league's own settings on the shared category
  subset, now drive a K/IDP epistemic disagreement signal (epistemic-only; the mean stays
  Sleeper's, because ESPN projects no TFL and a blended mean would be biased low). Do not
  extend the points blend to K/IDP -- that half of the exclusion still holds -- and keep
  sync's shared-subset keys in lockstep with the ESPN map in clients/espn.py.
- `VACATED_VOLUME_CAPTURE_RATE = 0.65` is explicitly **not** rigorously derived. It is carried
  over and documented as such. Do not silently re-tune it; if you have a real source, say so.
- Mean-weighted vacated-volume apportionment was long suspected backwards in the handcuff
  case, and F24 (2026-09-03) **measured it as correct**: on 8 real 2025 lead-RB absences,
  mean-weighting ties depth weighting and matches observed inheritance concentration, and in
  the one live chart-vs-mean disagreement the CHART was wrong (Commissioner Exempt listing).
  Do not switch to `depth_chart_order` weighting; the sync depth watchdog surfaces live
  disagreements for human judgment.
- `INJURY_RATES` for TE/QB/DL/LB/DB are less rigorously sourced than RB/WR. This is documented
  in `config.py`. Improving them requires real position-specific data, not interpolation.
- `MANAGER_PROFILES`: `trade_will` remains deliberately excluded from data-driven
  calibration — per-manager sample size is far too small, and an optimiser tuning it would
  compensate for errors elsewhere. That reasoning originally covered the whole dict and was
  right when per-manager data was guesswork; F31 (2026-09-03) changed the evidentiary
  situation for the FAAB half specifically: `faab_agg`/`faab_activity` are DERIVED from the
  99 attributed 2025 claims (several old guesses were contradicted outright — Quantum
  Ferrets guessed 0.15, measured 1.36), labeled 2025-derived PRIORS, and blended with this
  season's decision-log claims at engine init with a decaying prior weight. Still never
  optimiser-tuned: measured directly or not at all.
- **No type annotations, by scope decision (2026-09-05).** The correctness bar is
  statistical (goldens, gate, property tests); annotating the golden-pinned monoliths is
  Phase 8 work. Do not add hints piecemeal -- a half-annotated codebase invites tooling
  that the un-annotated half then fights.
- **`scripts.live_matchup` applies NO availability discount to a pre-game starter**
  (F51, 2026-09-20). Its number reads "if everyone plays" and therefore sits ABOVE the
  simulation's `expected_total`; the gap between them is the availability risk still on
  the table. Over a season availability is actuarial and the engine prices it; inside one
  live matchup it is a decision the owner hedges by hand off the Saturday designations.
  Do not add a `p_zero` or inactive haircut here. Do check both rosters' Questionable
  counts before trusting a live margin -- the optimism only cancels when they are
  comparable. Note `Questionable` is in no tool's absence set: `INITIAL_ABSENCE_STATUSES`
  is ('IR','PUP','Out','Sus','DNR','NA').
- `FantasySimulationEngine` is deliberately one class. Its methods share substantial state;
  splitting it is a real architectural change, not a tidy-up.

## Release policy

Semantic versions, tied to what this repo already enforces (baseline: v1.0.0, tagged at
the F27 commit, 2026-09-03):

- **MAJOR** -- the model's predictions change materially. Operationally: **any intended
  golden-master regeneration, OR any change to sync-time constants that alter
  `player_baselines.json`** (`VOLATILITY_CONSTANTS`, `EPISTEMIC_ERROR_RATES`,
  `BASE_STREAMER_MEANS`, the blend weights) -- **which the goldens cannot detect**: the
  engine consumes `std_aleatoric` baked in at sync time, so a sync-time recalibration
  regenerates nothing while changing every prediction (learned from F28, whose golden
  deltas were byte-identical). **A THIRD trigger, added at v8.0.0 (F84): any change to an
  engine INPUT the goldens structurally cannot see.** F84 switched the banked wins and
  points from the recomputed weekly actuals to the league's standings; the golden fixtures'
  standings are stale, so they fall back and the goldens stay byte-identical *by
  construction* — while live playoff probability moved up to 6.1 points. Enumerating two
  triggers under-called it; the test is the headline, not the list. A commit doing any of
  the three says "MAJOR pending" in its message, and the tag lands with the release notes, not the commit. Every tag also
  gets a headline entry in CHANGELOG.md, the pyproject.toml version bump, and
  CITATION.cff's `version` AND `date-released` in the same sitting (docs guards pin
  pyproject and the citation version to the latest tag, and H4 added the date: a
  citation naming the right release on the wrong date is wrong in the one field a
  citation exists to carry -- it read 2026-09-05 at v7.0.0, two tags stale) -- the changelog exists so
  the release history is visible from the file list, and an unlisted tag is exactly the
  staleness class this repo keeps re-learning.
- **MINOR** -- capability added, goldens byte-identical (new tools, report sections, CI,
  coverage).
- **MINOR also covers an additive engine export** (owner ruling 2026-09-28, docs/WEB_UI_ROADMAP.md
  Decision 1). A change that only ADDS a saved output -- every existing golden hash
  byte-identical in all three stages -- is MINOR: the goldens are regenerated in a commit of
  their own whose diff is shown to be the new entries and nothing else. A change to any
  existing hash stays MAJOR, and so does anything that alters a draw.
- **PATCH** -- fixes and docs that move neither.
- **The behaviour check runs on BOTH scenarios before a MAJOR** (M2): `week01` and
  `--scenario week06`. week01 has no completed weeks and therefore no blend, so a
  posterior-scoped change drifts nothing there (F54, F62).
- **Milestone tags also carry the week's embed digest as a release asset** (F36's
  retention decision, 2026-09-04): workflow artifacts expire at 90 days, the orphan-
  branch alternative bloats every clone, and release assets are permanent -- attach
  the current `_embed.html` when cutting each milestone release.
- **Season milestones, regardless of code**: cut a tag (at least PATCH) at week 5-6
  (F25's quoted-vs-realized calibration first measurable), week 11 (trade deadline),
  week 15 (playoffs), and season end (F7/F8/F18/F19 unblock together) -- an addressable
  snapshot at each evidence milestone is what makes "the model said X at the deadline"
  checkable later.

The reminder lives in `scripts.run_windows` (the scheduled read-only status tool), not in
a test: a commit-time gate on a release-time act would fail every commit between a golden
regeneration and its tag and teach itself to be ignored. It flags a pending MAJOR
(goldens changed since the latest tag), arrived milestone weeks (two-week window, then
quiet), and -- because GitHub's release UI tags server-side -- says `git fetch --tags`
when the clone sees no tags rather than misreporting "untagged".

**Release-note template** (v1.0.0 is the baseline; it folds sections 3-5 into one "not
done" block, which is acceptable -- the split below is preferred because "blocked on X"
and "not blocked but not done" are different honesty claims):

1. **What's in it** -- user-visible changes only; MAJOR/MINOR items named.
2. **What the audit found** -- counts copied from AUDIT_SUMMARY.md's grand-total row (the
   guarded single source; tests/test_docs ties the README to the same row).
3. **Blocked on hardware** -- R1 state, verbatim from its AUDIT_PLAN entry.
4. **Blocked on season data** -- the F-numbers and their unlock weeks.
5. **Not blocked, not done** -- the honest backlog.
6. **What this tag does not claim** -- standing caveats (IDP constants underived,
   the interval-dispersion bracket, coverage = execution on the monoliths, and whatever
   else is true at tag time).

## Statistical conventions

- Aleatoric variance is redrawn weekly. Epistemic variance is drawn **once per simulated season**
  and held fixed — this correctly propagates parameter uncertainty to season-level outcomes.
  Do not "simplify" this into a single draw.
- Lineups are chosen on `expected_pre` (pre-game expectation), never on realised `final_score`.
  Any change that lets realised outcomes influence lineup selection is lookahead leakage and is
  a serious bug.
- Vacated injury volume must be conserved: total apportioned never exceeds total vacated.

## The audit

`docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` is the working spec. Phases are organised by property class (conservation,
orientation, invariance, bounds, liveness) rather than by file, because every defect found so far
came from asking a property question rather than reading code linearly.

Work one phase per session. Record findings as you go. Do not start Phase 8 (engineering /
decomposition) before Phase 0 (reproducibility harness) is complete.

## In plain terms

Fantasy sites give each player one projected number. This project gives each player a
range of likely scores instead, built from data on how much that player's results really
swing from week to week. It then plays out the rest of the season 10,000 times, with
different luck each time. Questions like "will I make the playoffs?" are answered by
counting: a team that makes it in 6,800 of the 10,000 simulated seasons has a 68%
chance. Every probability in the reports is a count of that kind, and the model is
checked against what actually happened in this league last year. For a five-minute
guided tour with the outputs already rendered, start with
[the walkthrough notebook](docs/demo.ipynb).

**What this is:** a Monte Carlo season simulator and seven decision tools for a real
IDP fantasy league. Each run simulates 10,000 seasons forward from the current week.
Every projection is a distribution. Every probability carries a standard error.

**What makes it different:** the audit trail. **~129 findings and tracked follow-ups
across 8 audit phases: 94 fixed or built, six suspected defects measured-and-cleared, 5
fixes reverted on real-data evidence. The full ledger is [AUDIT_SUMMARY.md](AUDIT_SUMMARY.md).**
Every fix required a test that failed first. Every constant cites a source or says
"unverified". A byte-exact 15-test golden master and a per-commit real-data backtest
gate decide what ships. When a measurement cleared a suspected defect, the claim was
retired instead of "fixed" (F13, F14, F16, F20, F23, F24).

**Pre-registered:** the season's success criteria -- calibration, points-for, and the
coverage gap -- were committed and sha256-locked **before any game was played**, with
record and playoff results explicitly scored as neither success nor failure:
[SEASON_2026_EVALUATION.md](SEASON_2026_EVALUATION.md). A tamper guard hashes the file
on every test run.

**How it was built:** with Claude Code. The audit methodology, the accept/reject decision
on every finding, and the domain judgment are mine. The code is largely AI-generated.
The experiment is whether disciplined verification can make AI-generated code
trustworthy. The audit trail above is the evidence either way.

</picture>

*The Home page before kickoff. This week's matchup leads, with the model's chance to win and each side's projection; below it the other games, the season outlook (playoff odds, where I finish, expected wins week by week, drawn from the league's own results for the weeks already played) and the standings, each team's odds line beside the change since the last forecast. Team names are the league's pseudonyms; the players, projections and scores are real. Every screenshot here is retaken by `scripts.readme_shots` (pseudonyms only, no player photos) and a docs guard fails the commit when the pages change without them.*

**Identity note:** manager and team identities in this repository are pseudonymized
(F37): fictional team names, roster-id keys, league IDs in environment variables only.
Every number is real — projections, transactions, results — and the pseudonymization is
itself test-pinned (a leak check gates the public site; goldens and a behavioral
baseline proved the rename changed nothing).

**[Open the public site](https://brandon-kimberly.github.io/syndicate-football/)** -- the web UI itself, as anyone can see it: the week's matchup and odds, the standings, every team and player, the playoff picture, the history. It is a static snapshot of the simple view from my team's point of view, rebuilt after each week's official model run (`scripts.build_public_site`, the `pages-site` workflow). Team names are stand-ins and there are no images; nothing that needs a server is on it (no tools, no chat, no live scores). Before anything is published, a leak check takes every real team name, username and league id from Sleeper and refuses to publish on a single match. It replaced the legacy sample report.

![Per-player simulated weekly-score distributions: one violin per starter, colored by position, with quartile lines and the bust tail visible](docs/sample_boom_bust.png)
*From the weekly digest. Each violin is one starter's simulated week: the upside, the
bust tail, and the quartiles in one look. Seeing the whole distribution is the point of
simulating instead of projecting.*

## Weekly use: one command

```bash
py -3.10 -m scripts.weekly_report            # sync -> simulate -> charts -> grades -> lineup -> matchup -> waivers
py -3.10 -m scripts.weekly_report --full     # ... plus the trade-target finder (--evaluate N runs tool 2 on the top N)
py -3.10 -m scripts.weekly_report --embed    # inline the charts (portable single HTML, ~15-20 MB)
py -3.10 -m scripts.check_freshness          # one glance: has sync run this week, and did it succeed?
```

With no arguments it uses `config.MY_TEAM` and the synced week. The orchestrator chains
every step in-process and writes one consolidated digest, as sortable-table HTML plus
Markdown, to `data/decisions/week_NN/` (`--canonical`) or `week_NN/archive/` (default).
`--embed` inlines every chart. That file is several MB, and the `_embed` suffix warns
you before opening.

**It fails loud.** Any step that raises, or leaves no data behind, stops the chain,
writes the digest with a `FAILED AT STEP ...` banner and no downstream sections, and
exits 1. Nothing runs on stale or partial data. A sync that tolerated failures leads
the digest with its `DEGRADED` list every week it persists. These gates exist because
an earlier defect silently truncated real data on every suite run and was found only by
accident (`docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` F11).

## Local web UI — Syndicate

```bash
py -3.10 -m pip install -r requirements-web.txt   # Flask, kept out of the golden-pinned requirements.txt
py -3.10 -m webui                                  # http://127.0.0.1:8765/  (--port, --root, --no-real-names)
                                                   # Chat page: ask Claude about the league, read-only, on your subscription (docs/WEB_UI.md)
```

A **localhost-only** reader over everything the scripts write -- a landing page with this
week's matchup as the model priced it, the playoff ring, the expected-wins sparkline,
standings and a watch list, plus a health strip; then every week's forecast and charts,
the canonical and archived decision records and digests, the current rosters and
standings, the season logs, and a System page for the sync, the run windows and the logs'
push state -- served straight from `data/`, never copied. The design, its phases and its constraints are in
`docs/WEB_UI.md`; the three that shape it: the web process **never imports the engine**
(importing it truncates `syndicate_warnings.log`; a subprocess test pins this), it never
`chdir`s (one absolute root, one path chokepoint that refuses `data/local/` and anything
outside `data/`), and real names are an in-memory overlay on response bodies only --
files, URLs and logs stay pseudonymous. It binds `127.0.0.1` with no `--host` option
(`--hostname` adds a local name such as `syndicatefootball.local`) and refuses any other
`Host` header. Syncing has its own page, behind a User-scope key probe and a backup of
`data/current/` (docs/WEB_UI.md W4); the tools never sync. Two views share one codebase:
the developer's, and a simple one anyone could use (W8), toggled from the footer.

*The League page. Each record as the league counts it -- head-to-head and median games -- points for and against to the cent as Sleeper prints them, streaks, playoff and title odds with their move since the last forecast, final-win ranges, roster strength and budgets. Past weeks are the scores the league banked, found and checked to the cent against its own totals (`fantasy_sim.banked_scores`).*

  <img alt="Every team's playoff odds across the season's forecasts, one line each in the team's own colour, mine drawn thicker" src="docs/webui_odds_race_light.webp">
</picture>

*The Forecasts page. One line per team across every forecast the model has run, so the season reads as odds moving rather than a single number; numbered markers name the moves behind the biggest swings. Round ticks, end labels spaced so each stays readable, and a hover crosshair naming every team at that week.*

**Chat.** A Chat page answers questions about the league -- waivers, lineups, trades -- by running Claude Code headless on the owner's own subscription (no API key, nothing billed beyond the plan). It is read-only by construction: every built-in tool is off, and its only tools read a copy of the data and run the same allowlisted analysis tools as the Tools page, in that copy (docs/WEB_UI.md).

**Tools and jobs.** The decision tools below can be launched from the UI as the exact
command you would type -- one subprocess in the checkout, one at a time. Every launch
takes the same lock (an in-process lock, a pid lock file, and a scan for any other engine
process on the machine), every POST carries a per-launch CSRF token, and a job that exits
non-zero or is cancelled is shown **VOID** with the R1 sentence, never "finished with
errors". Job logs live under `data/local/webui/` and are never committed or served as files.
The two engine entry points run the same way: `run_simulation`, and `weekly_report` --
which the Tools page **always** launches with `--skip-sync`, after showing the freshness
verdict and the run windows, and refuses outright on a STALE tree. Sync runs only from the
Sync page: the odds key is read from the Windows User scope and probed first, `data/current/`
is backed up (with a restore button), and the verified key reaches the child process through
its environment alone.

## Decision tools

Each is a script under `scripts/` and a function in `fantasy_sim.decisions`. They read
`data/current/` only, write their JSON records to `data/decisions/`, and never touch the
season exports. The engine is not modified. The one extraction made for them
(`_weekly_score_from_z`) is pinned byte-identical by the golden master.

| Question | Tool |
|---|---|
| Start A or B this week? P(A > B) computed from the players' *joint* simulated distributions. | `py -3.10 -m scripts.compare_players "Player A" "Player B" [--light]` |
| What lineup does the engine's own rule set, and by how much? Each starter's p10/p50/p90 and the margin over the best bench alternative. | `py -3.10 -m scripts.optimize_lineup` |
| Against *this week's opponent*, play safe or swing for variance? Four lineup constructions on one joint sample, each with P(beat opponent) and P(beat median). | `py -3.10 -m scripts.matchup_lineup [--no-cross]` |
| Who should I claim, and what should I bid? Roster gaps against the free-agent pool, ranked by value over replacement, with P(beats my incumbent). | `py -3.10 -m scripts.waiver_targets [--positions RB,WR]` |
| Is this specific trade good for me? Two paired full simulations on the same seeds, and the Champ%/Playoff% delta for both sides and every bystander. | `py -3.10 -m scripts.evaluate_trade --team-a ... --a-gives ... --team-b ... --b-gives ...` |
| Who should I be trading for, and who wants what I have? Buried bench players who would start for me, and my surplus that has a buyer. | `py -3.10 -m scripts.find_trades [--evaluate N]` |
| What would ANY swap do? Every 1-for-1 and bounded 2-for-2 across the league on engine values, ranked by my gain, every row labelled unsimulated (B2/B15). | `py -3.10 -m scripts.find_trades --exhaustive [--require-mutual] [--evaluate N]` |
| How good is each roster, really? Tier and VORP per position and overall, and a league table by lineup VORP. | `py -3.10 -m scripts.roster_grades [--team ...]` |

## How the model works

The consolidated statistical specification -- distributions, estimation procedures,
calibration results, and known limitations in one document -- is
[docs/METHODS.md](docs/METHODS.md). The short version:

- **Data pipeline** (`fantasy_sim.sync`): real Sleeper projections blended with an
  independent ESPN source, real Vegas totals and spreads, defensive strength derived from
  completed games with empirical-Bayes shrinkage, and live byes and availability. Every
  sync appends to the unrefetchable `data/logs/projection_log.jsonl` and writes the
  manifest *last*, so a manifest's presence means the sync completed.
- **Two-variance scores:** each player's week is lognormal. Aleatoric (week-to-week)
  variance is redrawn every week. Epistemic (projection) variance is drawn once per
  simulated season and held, which carries parameter uncertainty through to season
  outcomes rather than letting it average away.
- **Correlation:** same-NFL-team players move together through a Gaussian copula with
  measured coefficients.
- **Lineups on expectation, never on outcomes:** chosen by the Hungarian algorithm on
  pre-game expectation. Realised scores never influence selection. That would be
  lookahead leakage.
- **Injuries:** an onset hazard and a two-component duration mixture; vacated volume is
  conserved. A rostered player with no projection but an absence status (IR / PUP /
  Commissioner Exempt) is carried at his last data-sourced mean and returns on a measured
  hazard, never at a hand-typed healthy baseline.
- **Season mechanics:** waivers and FAAB bidding run stochastically through the season,
  calibrated to the real league's spending. An automatic trade mechanism runs but almost
  never completes a trade. That is a tracked limitation. The 4-team playoff is simulated,
  or seeded from banked standings when the run starts inside it.
- **Backtesting** (`fantasy_sim.backtest_season`, `backtest_player`,
  `scripts.run_points_backtest`): as-of-week inputs reconstructed from this league's real
  2025 season and run through the *actual, unmodified* engine. The player-level backtest
  checks the constants directly against real player-week data. Each states its own
  limitations in its docstring.

`config.py` holds every constant with its derivation or an explicit "unverified";
`storage.py` names every path the project reads or writes, once. `data/` has four buckets:
`current/` (the last sync's snapshot), `weeks/` (per-week exports and charts),
`decisions/` (tool records and digests), and `logs/` (append-only, git-tracked).

## Setup

Runtime is **Python 3.10** with the pins in `requirements.txt` (exact for the
numeric stack the goldens are byte-locked to; ranges for plumbing like `requests`):

```bash
py -3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
git config core.hooksPath hooks    # one-time: the docs guards run at pre-commit (~2s)
```

Optional: schedule `hooks/windows_check.ps1` daily (Task Scheduler, hidden). It logs
the canonical-window report to `data/windows_check.log` and pops a message box only
when a window needs action. Canonical runs commit and push `data/logs/` themselves;
`scripts.check_freshness` prints an ACTION line whenever log data is unpushed.

(Plain `python` resolves to a broken end-of-life 3.8 on the original machine; use
`py -3.10`. See `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` R1.)

Two credentials are read from environment variables, never hardcoded:

| Variable | Required for |
|---|---|
| `ODDS_API_KEY` | **Required for any correct in-season forecast.** Before the 2026-09-09 gate the engine runs on a hand-verified week-1 table; after it, this key is the only source of real lines. Without it every team gets a flat 21.5 total and no opponent. The sync manifest, `check_freshness` and the digest's DEGRADED block all say so loudly, but the forecast is matchup-blind. Free tier at the-odds-api.com. |
| `ESPN_S2`, `ESPN_SWID` | Only if the dedicated ESPN league is private. Without ESPN the blend and its disagreement-driven epistemic term simply do not apply. |

## Testing

```bash
py -3.10 -m unittest discover tests      # expected: Ran 2316 tests ... OK (skipped=1, expected failures=3)
py -3.10 -m coverage run -m unittest discover tests && py -3.10 -m coverage report --show-missing
                                         # branch coverage; the committed floor (coverage_floor.txt) gates the
                                         # fantasy_sim package. Standalone milestone scripts are measured but
                                         # not gated, since they are suite-external by design.
                                         # CAVEAT: high coverage on the two monoliths means the golden master RUNS them,
                                         # not that their behavior is asserted line-by-line.
py -3.10 -m tests.test_golden_master     # the reproducibility harness: 15 tests, three scenarios, byte-exact hashes
```

**Scope note:** the codebase deliberately carries no type annotations. The correctness
bar here is statistical -- byte-exact goldens, a real-data backtest gate, and property
tests carry the load that annotations would only partially duplicate -- and annotating
the two golden-pinned monoliths is Phase 8 work, blocked until the R1 hardware is
replaced. A scope decision, not an oversight.

**Platform note:** the golden master is byte-locked to the Windows platform that
generated it (the documented lock in `tests/golden_master.py`; CI runs `windows-latest`
for the same reason). On Linux or macOS, expect exactly those 15 golden tests to fail on
float-representation differences while the rest of the suite passes -- that is the
platform lock working, not a broken build.

The skip is the live-ingestion test (`RUN_LIVE_INGESTION_TESTS=1` runs it); the three
expected failures are deliberate red characterisations of tracked open items. Without
Flask (`requirements-web.txt`) the web UI's route tests skip cleanly too, the same way
the `espn_api` and `hypothesis` tests do -- `skipped=444`, not a failure. The fifty-one
browser tests also need Playwright and an Edge or Chrome to drive; without them they skip
as well (`skipped=52`). Any engine
change either leaves the golden hashes byte-identical or regenerates them with the deltas
explained in the commit.

## Validation and audit trail

**The 2026 season's success criteria were committed before any game was played.**
Calibration, points-for, and the coverage gap, with record/playoffs scored as neither
success nor failure: [SEASON_2026_EVALUATION.md](SEASON_2026_EVALUATION.md).

This is the part of the project to read first if you want to know whether the numbers can be
trusted. The model was audited phase by phase, organised by property class (conservation,
orientation, invariance, bounds, liveness), and every finding, fix and deliberate non-fix
is recorded:

- **`AUDIT_SUMMARY.md`**: the whole arc on one page. Phases 0-7, what was found, fixed, and left
  open, with the numbers.
- **`docs/audit/AUDIT_PHASE_0_FINDINGS.md` … `docs/audit/AUDIT_PHASE_7_FINDINGS.md`**: seven phase reports
  (reproducibility harness; conservation and invariants; the statistical core; data ingestion
  integrity; decision logic; season and playoff mechanics + outputs; calibration).
- **`docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md`**: the working spec, with 61 tracked follow-ups (F1-F61), each with
  Origin / Scope / Acceptance criterion / When, and its outcome when closed, and the R1
  machine-fault investigation.
- **`docs/WAIVER_MECHANICS.md`**: whether a claim can *land* — on-waivers vs free-agent and
  the UI tell, how to make only one of several alternative claims succeed, and the IR rules
  (an open IR slot removes the need for a drop; `NA` and `Sus` are not IR-eligible). League
  settings verified live, not transcribed; these are mechanics, not what a claim is worth.

Beyond the summary line above: a **real-data backtest gate** on this league's 2025 season
(points bias, mean z, coverage, logged per commit and interpreter) that every
correlation- or scoring-adjacent change must pass; constants measured on real player-week
data (copula correlations re-confirmed league-wide on 391 players / 714 pooled
pair-weeks); and disagreements with an external audit settled by measurement (tail
dependence measured and deliberately not adopted; the 80-point cap re-measured on
playoff equity and kept).

## Adapting this to your own league

**The single most important thing first: the constants were measured in *this* league's scoring
system and need re-deriving for yours.** `VOLATILITY_CONSTANTS`, `EPISTEMIC_ERROR_RATES`,
`SIM_CONFIG['CORRELATIONS']`, the injury onset/duration/return parameters and the replacement
levels were all calibrated on real player-week data scored *this way* (`backtest_player`, F13,
F4/F5) and validated against *this* league's 2025 history. Change the scoring or the roster
format and those numbers are no longer sourced for your league. Re-run
`scripts.run_player_backtest` on your own league's data and re-establish the backtest
gate before trusting the outputs. Editing the IDs below without doing that produces a
professional-looking forecast whose constants belong to someone else's league.

**Straightforward, config-only edits** (`fantasy_sim/config.py`):
- `LEAGUE_ID`, `MY_TEAM`, `TEAM_NAME_MAP` (Sleeper display names -> your team labels),
  `ESPN_LEAGUE_ID` + `ESPN_S2`/`ESPN_SWID` (optional second source), `ODDS_API_KEY`.
- `MANAGER_PROFILES` (measured as outcome-inert; neutral values are a fine start),
  `KNOWN_MISSING_ASSETS` and `DUAL_ELIGIBILITY` (league-specific players).

**Format assumptions baked into the code**, beyond the config:
- **8 teams.** The trade block ranks standings as `[0:2]` rich / `[4:8]` desperate; the
  median-beat decision, all-play and seeding assume the league size; `TEAM_NAME_MAP` and
  `MANAGER_PROFILES` are eight entries.
- **14-week regular season, 4-team playoff in weeks 15-16** (`REGULAR_SEASON_WEEKS`, `top4`,
  the bracket seeding and the week-17 refusal).
- **Roster structure.** `REQUIRED_STARTING_SLOTS` (13: QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, TE, 3 FLEX, K, DL, LB, DB)
  drives the Hungarian assignment, the streamer scan, replacement levels and VORP;
  `ACTIVE_ROSTER_LIMIT = 19` in the trade evaluator; `BASE_STREAMER_MEANS` per slot.
- **IDP.** DL/LB/DB slots with Sleeper's raw positions normalised (DE/DT/NT -> DL, CB/S/FS/SS ->
  DB). The IDP variance, epistemic and injury constants are *less rigorously sourced* than the
  offensive ones (documented in `config.py`), and the ESPN blend excludes K and IDP by design.
  A non-IDP league removes slots and loses nothing statistically. A new position needs new
  constants with sources.
- **Hybrid H2H + weekly-median scoring** (`SIM_CONFIG['MEDIAN_SCORING_ENABLED']`): two decisions
  per week, 28 max. The 2025 backtest runs with it *off* because that season was pure H2H.
  The flag exists so a season is simulated under the rules that applied to it.
- **2026-specific reference data:** `WEEK_1_VERIFIED_VEGAS` (a hand-verified preseason table
  that expires at the odds gate), `NFL_TEAMS`, and bye weeks derived from the live schedule.
